    IoT Homework 9 Problem 1

    Reads voltage on AIN0 P9_39 and assesses the equivalent resistance based on
    10k立 resistor connecting P9_32 to 39, then outputs status messages to screen
    Resistor being tested should be in the range of 100立 to 100k立

    Example invocation: ./read_resistance
